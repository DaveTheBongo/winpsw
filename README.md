# winpsw.py
Simply generates passwords. 
Uses customtkinter to select output. 
Passwords are of any size and any quantity using at least one chr_type: lowercase, uppercase, digits and/or symbols. 
I have checked the distribution of the output to ensure randomness: 97_000_000 times and the results were +/- 0.25%.
